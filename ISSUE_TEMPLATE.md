#### By submitting this, I agree that:
* I am not a 13 year old who is trying to disconnect his friends from their wifi.
* I know what this app is supposed to do.
* I know what monitor-mode and a wifi adapter is, and what the firmware has to do with it.
* I have read the project's README and it didn't help.
* I don't speak 3rd grade english and my sentences make sense.
